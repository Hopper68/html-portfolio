<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a Technical Support Professional who is passionate about learning new things, 
  and even more about relearning old things in a new way. This includes this refresher 
  on how to write HTML, CSS, JavaScript and other stuff soon.</p>

<p>I intend to use this as a boilerplate to host a more professional version of my 
  profile for prospective employers soon.</p>
